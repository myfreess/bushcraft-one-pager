# bushcraft-one-pager

This directory contains a 1 page summary of bushcraft information
which has been taken from a variety of sources. If you are running
bushcraft activities or need a summary for your kit this is a
starting place. Of course the real sources:

* Richard Graves Bushcraft books
* WA Police Guide:Aids to Survival
* Ray Mears, Mors, Bob Cooper, etc

I might add some documents here if there is interest, or perhaps
a archive with some other info on this topic.
